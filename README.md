## About Me

Hello, my name is Vladimir. I'm 23 years old. I live now in Minsk, Belarus. I am Software Engineer.<br>
I graduated a faculty of computer systems and networks from Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics 2 years ago and am currently attending the RSSchool frontend course. I learned the basic knowledge of programming at the university. I learned languages like C, Assembly Language, VHDL, Matlab.
How did I decide to become a frontend developer? I initially entered the university without a specific goal. Students in my department study circuit board design, microcontroller programming, and digital system design. In the 4th year of university, I was introduced to web programming. Then I realized that I want to develop in this direction. A friend advised me to take RSS courses.<br>
What do I like about programming?<br>
I like to solve algorithmic and mathematical problems, so I like to program.
I am taking RSS courses for the second time. For the first time, I took the course to the very end.
I can tell you about the most recent task that is performed in the team. Our team consisted of 4 people. Our Goal: Make a clone of the Trello app. Trello is a team work service that allows you to plan and publish current tasks, organize them, and monitor their execution. It is based on the Japanese kanban board system – a convenient tool for organizing work. I was responsible for the following app features:
1) Add, delete, and edit the task list
2) Adding, editing the description by the task creator
3) The ability to leave comments under a specific task to other users.
The main technical difficulties were:
  - configuring webpack, i.e. incorporation of assets
  - drag and drop realization
  - binding boards and lists
  - backend realization<br>
 
Each member of the team made a huge contribution to our final project and as a result we received the maximum score. We also wrote an article about our app on the medium portal and made a video about how our app works.
This project was a cool learning exercise to sharpen skills and a wonderful oppotunity to work with others as a team. Thanks for your attention.
